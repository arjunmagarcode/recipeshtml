Links and images


Anchor elements
To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. 
An anchor element is defined by wrapping the 
text or another HTML element we want to be a link with an <a> tag.

    rel=You may have noticed that we snuck in the rel attribute above. 
    This attribute is used to describe 
    the relation between the current page and the linked document.
images 

img src =" " for the image and i have to use ./ and ../ depending on
the case of the level of the data


alt attributes 
The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place 
of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen
 readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.
If dog.jpg fails to load, users will see:

css
Copy code
A golden retriever playing with a ball


list is one of the most imporant aspect of the html. there are two types of list 
oneis unorderd list <ul>, and ordered list <ol>. 

each list items in an unordered list begins with a bullet point are created using
item element <li>

each lsit items in a orderd lsit begins with number anf are created using <li>

 <!-- 
 Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration. The doctype’s purpose 
 is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the 
 document. The latest version 
 of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is <!DOCTYPE html>.
 
 Head element
The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our
    webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in 
    the browser. Inside the <head>,
     we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.


     The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is
      the <body> element. This is where all the content that will be
         displayed to users will go - the text, 
        images, lists, links, and so on.

To complete the boilerplate, add a <body> element to the index.html 
    file. The <body> element also goes within the <html> element and is always below the <head> element, like so:
 -->



<!-- 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang= "en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title> My first wepage</title>
</head>

</html>


-->
<!-- 

The <title> element is used to give webpages a human-readable title, 
    which is displayed in our webpage’s browser tab. For example, if you 
    look at the current tab’s name of your browser, it will read “HTML 
    Boilerplate | The Odin Project”; 
    this is the <title> of the current .html file.

If we didn’t include a <title> element, the webpage’s title 
    would default to its file name. In our case that would be index.html,
     which isn’t very meaningful for users; this would make it 
     very difficult 
     to find our webpage if the user has many browser tabs open.






     Strong element
The <strong> element makes text bold. It also semantically marks text as 
    important; this affects tools, like screen readers, that users with 
    visual impairments will rely on to use your website. The tone of voice 
    on some screen readers will change to communicate the importance of the 
    text within a strong element. 
    To define a strong element, we wrap text content in a <strong> tag.
